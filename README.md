## Project Overview

This is a project i built back in 2023 when i was learning how to code.

While brainstorming ideas for a personal project, i decided to use code to design and build a PS4 Gamepad to further strengthen my skills by bringing abstract objects to life.  

For now, it was built with only HTML and CSS.

## Future Plans

Subsequently, it'll be modified to have other amazing features and functionalities using more advanced languages and frameworks.  

Expect more from this project. Cheers!!!
